                <h1>The only way to stem this tide is to stop our Middle East meddling: In a haunting dispatch from Syria, PETER OBORNE reveals the real reason the refugees keep coming </h1>
                <p> Three-year-old Aylan Kurdi was born into a loving family. But he could hardly have chosen a crueller time or a more dangerous place. His family home was the Syrian frontier town of Kobani, in the north of the country, right up by the Turkish border. His birth in 2012 would have been a moment of joy and celebration. But it came at a time when the life around him was overshadowed by fear. The Syrian civil war, now entering its fifth year, had been raging for more than 12 months. Kobani had been seized from government control by the Peoples Protection Unit, a force with strong links to the Kurdish PKK, which has been classified in the West as a terror group.</p>

                <p> But much worse was to come. When Aylan was just two and his brother Galip four, a murderous ISIS force, at the very least tacitly supported by neighbouring Turkey, marched into the town. What followed was sheer horror. ISIS murdered the men of Kobani and kidnapped the women. In the months that followed the town was reduced to rubble as Kurdish forces, backed by U.S. air strikes, sought to seize back control. By then the Kurdi family are reported to have already fled. But this fresh wave of terror must have forced them to abandon all hope of a return and make their fatal decision to escape to Europe. The family at first made their way to Turkey, from where they tried three times to escape to Europe by sea.</p>

            <h1>John Kasich Set to Hit New Milestone in Presidential Campaign</h1>

            <p>The town of Bow, smack dab between New Hampshire’s capital and largest city, is home to just over 7,500 people. But Republican presidential candidate John Kasich has held three town hall meetings there.</p>
            <p>The Ohio governor is set to hold his 100th town hall in the Granite State this evening after months spent crisscrossing the state, introducing himself to voters. He’s held more town halls than his GOP competitors, many of whom have struggled to stand out in a field dominated by candidates with names like Donald Trump and Marco Rubio.</p>
            <p>His strategy has centered on the importance New Hampshire voters place on personal interactions with candidates. In an oft-told joke here, one man tells another he’s unsure what he thinks of a candidate since, “I’ve only met him twice.”</p>
            <p>Linda Fowler, a professor of government at Dartmouth College, in Dartmouth, New Hampshire, said town hall events may be a "hundred-year tradition of retail politics" but their impact on voters may be diminished this year because of the large number of candidates.</p>
            <p>“I think they've helped, but...not as much as one might have thought," she said in an interview. "There are so many candidates for voters to sort through, so face-to-face campaigning is not having as much of an effect on candidates’ standing in the polls."</p>
