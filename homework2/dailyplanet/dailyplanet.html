            <h1>The only way to stem this tide is to stop our Middle East meddling: In a haunting dispatch from Syria, PETER OBORNE reveals the real reason the refugees keep coming </h1>
            <p> Three-year-old Aylan Kurdi was born into a loving family. But he could hardly have chosen a crueller time or a more dangerous place. His family home was the Syrian frontier town of Kobani, in the north of the country, right up by the Turkish border. His birth in 2012 would have been a moment of joy and celebration. But it came at a time when the life around him was overshadowed by fear. The Syrian civil war, now entering its fifth year, had been raging for more than 12 months. Kobani had been seized from government control by the Peoples Protection Unit, a force with strong links to the Kurdish PKK, which has been classified in the West as a terror group.</p>

            <p> But much worse was to come. When Aylan was just two and his brother Galip four, a murderous ISIS force, at the very least tacitly supported by neighbouring Turkey, marched into the town. What followed was sheer horror. ISIS murdered the men of Kobani and kidnapped the women. In the months that followed the town was reduced to rubble as Kurdish forces, backed by U.S. air strikes, sought to seize back control. By then the Kurdi family are reported to have already fled. But this fresh wave of terror must have forced them to abandon all hope of a return and make their fatal decision to escape to Europe. The family at first made their way to Turkey, from where they tried three times to escape to Europe by sea.</p>

        <h1>NASHUA, N.H. — Is it now or never for Gov. Chris Christie's presidential campaign?</h1>

        <p>The New Hampshire primary — the contest in which Christie has staked his White House hopes — is just days away, and the New Jersey governor's poll numbers are slipping at just the wrong time. With time running out, Christie shifted gears this week and has gone into full attack mode against Republican rivals he's trailing. The governor who resisted the urge to attack GOP rivals and instead focused on Democrats Hillary Clinton and President Obama has been replaced by a candidate who needs no urging to go on the offensive against his competition.</p>
